<div class="workpage_left">

<h2>Alpine Hike and Fly - Austria to Monaco</h2>
Tandem flying, hiking, camping the route of the 2019 Redbull X-Alps Hike and Fly Competition with US Paragliding Champion and X-Alps alumni. Fully supported in the same way an X-Alps athlete would be, and following the same rules. Requires a high level of physical fitness (this isn't a put your feet up vacation). Start in Austria and end up with a Mediternean Sea landing in next to the yachts of Monaco, traveling the entirety of the Alps in air and on land in two weeks time.
