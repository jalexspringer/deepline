After some questionable weather in the western Alps I made the decision to skip the volbiv and try for a bit more vol. With the Naviter Open coming up I wanted to get a feel for the arena and headed out to Slovenia! Lots of flying but very low cloudbase:

Really interesting terrain and I learned a lot about patience, as well as my new glider. Absolutely in love with the way the OXA3 feels in the air.

From there I headed off to Lake Garda - cable car to launch is a luxury, as is a launch the size of 5 football pitches! Little hike and fly to the peak of Mt Baldo, top land for a quick bite, launch for a longer flight and a little exploring up and down the range. Again a very low cloud base so not much XC potential, but a beautiful way to spend a couple of days hanging out at the lake.
