# A Beautiful Day to Fly - and a Lockdown
So the FFVL has [issued a strong recommendation](https://federation.ffvl.fr/actu/19-mars-communique-tous-les-pratiquants-vol-libre) that we stay on the ground so as not to put any additional potential strain on emergency services. Which I will through gritted teeth comply with and simply go 'exercise' by ground handling, hiking, and running a bunch.

But just for practice's sake, here is today's very flyable forecast.

**TL:DR Great local day, decent cross country chance if I can get over the back. I'd for sure be in the air.**

## The Rock is...
Slightly dry and wind-blown.

Very little wind up the mountain-side at 11am, but the cumulus were already popping by 9am and zipping across the sky a fair bit above the peaks.


## Weather to Fly
### Skysight Thermal Height
![Skysight Thermal Height](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/SSgreo20-3-20.png?format=auto&width=1250&compress=true)

Decent height above ground, definitely enough for areally pleasant local flight. Probably tough to go full cross country.

### Skysight Skew-T

### Windy... wind - 1000m AGL
![Windy Multi-Model Wind Forecast](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/WINDYgreo20-3.png?format=auto&width=1250&compress=true)

6-8 kt wind at 1000m above ground on nearly every model, but the local wind here looks a bit stronger based on the clouds.

It doesn't look like March is ideal for XC here - many more of these routes start in Gourdon, a 30 minute drive south of Gréolières.
