# True Exploration
Explore a new way of traveling. We don't offer package tours or large groups - we connect you with the experience of the elite. So if you are at the top of your game and want to see the world from the top of a different one - you are in the right place.

# World Class Athletes
Team up with the professionals - individuals who have spent their pushing the boundaries of what is possible on land, in the air, and on the sea. These athletes are at the top of their sport, winning awards and defining the next generation of adventure.

# Unique Experiences
These aren't tours that happen ten times a summer for large groups - we create diverse scenarios borrowing from the toughest races, adventures, and challenges on the planet.

Fully supported in the same way an X-Alps athlete would be, and following the same rules. Requires a high level of physical fitness (this isn't a put your feet up vacation). Start in Austria and end up with a Mediternean Sea landing in next to the yachts of Monaco, traveling the entirety of the Alps in air and on land in two weeks time.
