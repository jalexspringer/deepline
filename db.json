I look across the valley and see the river run, winding through hills and when I can not see it any longer the curves and riges of the earth draw my eyes up the granite cliffs that meet on the horizon. Through the notch where they meet I could see the Mediterranean Sea if it didn’t blend right into the sky.</p>\n<p>The sun sets just over the shoulder of a peak at the end of the western leg of the valley and it lights up those clouds I dreamt of flying through all day. I jog the flats and downhills, trudge the uphill bits, and stumble upon 90 year old stonework and steel hiding a cold mountain water rushing through stone. I climb the rocks and enjoy the granite’s grip on hands and feet, wonderful after the shifting surface of the path.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/20/water-cave.jpg?format=auto&compress=true&mode=crop&crop=bottom&height=1500&ar=5:3\" alt=\"Water Cave\"></p>\n<p>On the way back down a man and his dog run with me for a bit. The dog is happy and friendly and clearly at home here on this mountainside. The man and I and pant off-tempo, lungs drawing in the clean air, feeling it cool as the sun no longer touches this slope. He stops, waves me to join, points upwards at the cliffs at an goat as it leaps from boulder to bush to hiding. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamois\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Chamois”</a>, he says and I nod like I have any idea what he just said. We smile together at the goat (goat-antelope?) and there isn’t a single thing in the world that could change the peace and simply joy there. He takes out his phone, tries to get a blurry picture, waves to me again and is off on the path, dog happily bounding after his master.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/20/valley.jpg?format=auto&compress=true&width=2000\" alt=\"Impending Sunset\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"Post-non-flight\"><a href=\"#Post-non-flight\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post-non-flight\"></a>Post-non-flight</h1><p>From a meteo perspective I think I was right - beautiful day for a local thermalling flight.

I seem to have survived. For now.</p>\n<p>Resulting not particularly <a href=\"https://www.paraglidingforum.com/leonardo/flight/2498819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interesting flight record is here.</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/greo1.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/397664399\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n<p>I also discovered that a GoPro is not really that much of a just turn it on and go device. Settings tweaking has begun.</p>\n<p>I’ve just come off of listening to the <a href=\"https://www.cloudbasemayhem.com/episode-98-learning-it-all-from-an-xc-master-alex-robe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Robe interview on the Cloudbase Mayhem</a> and I’m feeling inspired to attempt to replicate some of what his blog does except in English and with my own, considerably less knowledgable, less skilled, and less experienced thoughts/observations.</p>\n<p><strong>Really I just want to knock out 250km+ triangles with anything approaching the reliability and sheer coolness that he does.</strong></p>\n<p>I live in London and I am incredibly fortunate in that I travel often throughout Europe for my job while also have the flexibility to work remotely every so often. This lets me turn a business trip on a Thursday or Tuesday into a three day flying trip pretty easily but it also means I don’t often see the same site twice. I don’t have a ‘home site’ - in the ~20 months I’ve been flying I’ve flown in Mexico (Valle), Nepal (Pokhara), Ethiopia (another post or three’s worth of sites), Morocco, Spain (Ager), France (Annecy, Chamonix, Greolieres), the UK (Lake District), and the US (Owens Valley, Santa Barbara, Shenendoah Valley).</p>\n<p>This kind of discovery and travel is what I love about flying and I believe that the variety has made me a safer, and more well rounded pilot. It also has let me meet some of the best pilots around and be lucky enough to learn as much as my current skillset allows me to from them. But I also know that I am missing a ton of knowledge and I get what I can from the locals and the internets before I arrive. These posts are intended to help me record what I learn at these sites so I don’t have to start from scratch every time.</p>\n<p><strong>So here’s roughly what happens:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work schedules me to go somewhere. Or, a bank holiday or something pops up.</li>\n<li>I look for something resembling a mountain nearby. Hills are also acceptable, coastal soaring isn’t really my thing, and in one notable instance a 200 metre tall sand dune worked just fine. Cross Country Magazine’s travel guide is referenced for time of year suggestions.</li>\n<li>Then the fun stuff starts. I go raid the biggest flights from XContest for the site.

Off the training hill? Sold.\n\nI've been on the beaches and hiked the bluffs and ridges in Santa Barbara what must be hundreds of times, but soaring above them is the absolute best way to do it. One quick 10 minute flight, a quick stop off on the ground, and then I was off for an hour back and forth alond the ridge. Kept waiting for it to get old, going those same 100 yards over and over, but each lap had a little something new, a little bit of different challenge in it. Can I get higher on this next lap? Can I get past that horseshoe making that turbulent air over there and causing me to sink a ton?\n\nAdrenaline from the altitude and the speed (on the downwind leg at least) and the proximity to the cliffs.

Some turbulence here and there - good to get a feel for it and enough to let me know that I have a ways to go when it comes to knowing my glider and being completely in touch with its moods and inputs and outputs. Ton of altitude when I get to the LZ and it is a massive area to come down into. I aim at the dirt track leading to the car and come in swinging and hot, slide a bit on landing. Room to improve and I'm a bit unhappy with it because I know better. Already I'm into the zone where I want to get closer and closer to perfection with every flight - not enough to just slide through the air. I've got to justify the title of 'pilot'.\n\nDilan tells me world class pilots kite for an hour or two every day. That an hour of kiting is worth ten hours of flight time when it comes to being a better pilot. On it. I want to fly comps, and I want to fly acro.

Getting 10-20 flights per day on the excellent Santa Barbara Elings Park training hill with the kick ass instructors at Eagle Paragliding (thanks Drew, Dilan, and Brian in particular!).</p>\n<p>Less is more, sensitivity is important, and the adrenaline flows through me like water clearing out debris along its path. Relaxed effort is the key to efficiency and I can already tell that the feeling of being in complete sync with the wind is going to quickly become an addiction. I’m not even that good at it yet and it already begins to feel like the most natural thing in the world.</p>\n<p>So here’s to day 7 and the official P2 sign off. And here’s to practicing like a madman on ground and in the air to climb higher, smoother, and longer and travel the world with my head <em>just below</em> the clouds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/parastart.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Ridge-Soaring\"><a href=\"#Ridge-Soaring\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Ridge Soaring\"></a>Ridge Soaring</h2><p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/ridge-soaring.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>More than a minute or two in the air? Off the training hill? Sold.</p>\n<p>I’ve been on the beaches and hiked the bluffs and ridges in Santa Barbara what must be hundreds of times, but soaring above them is the absolute best way to do it. One quick 10 minute flight, a quick stop off on the ground, and then I was off for an hour back and forth alond the ridge. Kept waiting for it to get old, going those same 100 yards over and over, but each lap had a little something new, a little bit of different challenge in it. Can I get higher on this next lap? Can I get past that horseshoe making that turbulent air over there and causing me to sink a ton?</p>\n<p>Adrenaline from the altitude and the speed (on the downwind leg at least) and the proximity to the cliffs. But its also adrenaline that has to be handled in a mellow fashion, gently working with the wing to move how it needs to and how I want it to.</p>\n<p>I was getting hooked on the training hill. Some actual flight time? Line and sinker. I spent the rest of the night dreaming of the sky while walking through the night.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-mountain-flight\"><a href=\"#First-mountain-flight\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First mountain flight\"></a>First mountain flight</h2><p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/first-mountain.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Out of the car to Dilan yelling across the training hill - ‘going to the mountains’. The universe provides the perfect conditions to cap off my P2 training with a long (by my newbie standards) sled ride from the top of the mountain range.</p>\n<p>We get to VLR and I look out on the same view I’ve seen countless times before, all of Santa Barbara laid out below. This time I’m going to jump out over it. I’m calm and I’m ready to go. No jitters on launch, no fear, almost to a point where I’m concerned - should be some, right? But I know the glider will take care of me, and I know I’m ready to handle it up there. Or maybe I’m just OK with any outcome here.</p>\n<p>One false start, quick reset, and then the wing is up, I’m turned around, three steps later I’m off the edge and shaking dried out shrubbery from my legs. Head up looking out, down, over at the entire world and settling into my seat, relaxing into the flight and tuning in to the wing.</p>\n<p>The trip down has only a bit of lift - one thermal I managed to get around 3 or 4 times inside. Some turbulence here and there - good to get a feel for it and enough to let me know that I have a ways to go when it comes to knowing my glider and being completely in touch with its moods and inputs and outputs. Ton of altitude when I get to the LZ and it is a massive area to come down into. I aim at the dirt track leading to the car and come in swinging and hot, slide a bit on landing. Room to improve and I’m a bit unhappy with it because I know better. Already I’m into the zone where I want to get closer and closer to perfection with every flight - not enough to just slide through the air. I’ve got to justify the title of ‘pilot’.</p>\n<p>Dilan tells me world class pilots kite for an hour or two every day. That an hour of kiting is worth ten hours of flight time when it comes to being a better pilot. On it. I want to fly comps, and I want to fly acro. Basically I want to be in that harness, under that wing, and feel like they are as intuitive and comfortable and efficient as walking, as part of me as if they were my legs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/after-mountain.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Lifted\"><a href=\"#Lifted\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Lifted\"></a>Lifted</h2><p>Out of the ground and into the sky blurring the lines between solidity and air. The branches twist and grow in arcs toward and around each other, leaves dancing in sunlit rainbows of green, mingling with blue sky and white cloud. Whispering through the trunks is the color of my dreams and the quiet shadows are pierced by eternally sun drenched hopes, leaving cares to lie on the soft dead needles on the ground. Feet shuffle through the detritus as eyes turn to the sky, hands run along rough bark as cool air flows through flared nostrils and half opened lips.</p>\n<p>it is dreams of flight that drive me forward - lifting high above the world and leaving the works of man behind. checking in and out of what we have created as a people… what good do we do at the end of it all? driving towards a divine judgement gives some kind of hope that there is anything beyond futility. but what else can there be?

Through the white wooden pallet that serves as a headboard someone has strung small lights, and for those willing to risk the outlet hanging out of the wall the reward is crazed constellations of twinkling stars running from bed to wall and back.</p>\n<p>Douse the main light and turn on the stars and lay back on the coarse sheet, feel the hard wrinkles of the plastic mattress wrapper hidden beneath. It is chilly in this room - the back door doesn’t really close, the front door is drafty - and security is provided by a crumbling wall that you’d be crazy to try to climb. Or just hungry. Thick blanket up to neck and hands under arms for warmth. Close your eyes and listen.</p>\n<p>The faint glow just barely seeps in through eyelids and the street comes into the room. Under the purple bougainvillea hanging from the retaining wall on the street tinted shadows dance with a riot of colorful fabrics and silhouettes warped by the street lamps and headlights. Motorbike engines belch grand declarations of existence while trucks backfire and mingle with fireworks large and loud as cannon fire. The music is unceasing and it fades from background to foreground, reaches a climax as some enterprising local sets up a full set of speakers just outside the door and cranks up the sweet Mexican love songs. It is hard to tell the screams of joy from those of fear and nothing is to be done about either. A drunk stumbles by and his gait matches the cadence of his incoherent grunts and shouts. Left foot, sharp and angry, right foot drags in a slow moan. Friends and lovers meander by with smiles in their voices, their youth vibrant in their laughter. And finally come the mothers. In their quiet murmur are arms wrapped around precious bundles in thick blankets pulled up to little necks, hands tucked under arms for warmth.</p>\n<p>This is my room, my alley, my street in the Valley of the Brave, State of Mexico, Mexico. It is the Festival of Guadalupe, December 2018, and the entire world is here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/bluefly.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/guadalupe.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/horses.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/piano_penon.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/overthelake.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"><br><img src=\"https://deeplineproject.com/2018/12/30/Valle/sunset.jpg?format=auto&width=2000\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"ck8k0qgim0001e19w134y0izc","tag_id":"ck8k0qgip0003e19w7zxq2upg","_id":"ck8k0qgit0008e19w3rwxeve3"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgio0002e19w2xdb4fqb","tag_id":"ck8k0qgis0007e19wdr9ghn1e","_id":"ck8k0qgiv000de19w913k46k4"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiq0004e19wbqxz0irt","tag_id":"ck8k0qgiu000be19whyfzdkdw","_id":"ck8k0qgiw000he19w69nj44k8"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgir0005e19w1wad6e9x","tag_id":"ck8k0qgiw000fe19w0pac90yk","_id":"ck8k0qgiy000le19wbk3x7f7k"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgit0009e19w6ffc3vvd","tag_id":"ck8k0qgix000je19w17woau83","_id":"ck8k0qgj0000pe19welke2zp6"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiu000ae19wgvd2cxgn","tag_id":"ck8k0qgiu000be19whyfzdkdw","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000se19w63xa757k"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiu000ae19wgvd2cxgn","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj0000qe19w72qyggpq","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000te19wh61ua5dz"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiu000ce19weccf1ueu","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj1000re19w0guc6rke","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000ve19w8usa1uc1"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiv000ee19w5ap28q3s","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj1000ue19w41cr5o4s","_id":"ck8k0qgj2000xe19wammehkdu"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiw000ge19w60788xoj","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj1000we19we1ardn76","_id":"ck8k0qgj2000ze19w4uy63ybl"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgix000ke19w42ge8sro","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj2000ye19wcvgh46fh","_id":"ck8k0qgj20011e19wd7o7aiv5"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiy000me19wcmv67kei","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj20010e19w01mpais2","_id":"ck8k0qgj30013e19w5tz59dl7"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiz000ne19w0k9s2xg4","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj20012e19w9xx10bgz","_id":"ck8k0qgj30015e19w54a6avpr"},{"post_id":"ck8k0qgiz000ne19w0k9s2xg4","tag_id":"ck8k0qgj30014e19wcu429l05","_id":"ck8k0qgj30016e19w9soqb6wc"}],"Tag":[{"name":"goals","_id":"ck8k0qgip0003e19w7zxq2upg"},{"name":"spain","_id":"ck8k0qgis0007e19wdr9ghn1e"},{"name":"france","_id":"ck8k0qgiu000be19whyfzdkdw"},{"name":"ethiopia","_id":"ck8k0qgiw000fe19w0pac90yk"},{"name":"uk","_id":"ck8k0qgix000je19w17woau83"},{"name":"meteo","_id":"ck8k0qgj0000qe19w72qyggpq"},{"name":"morocco","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000re19w0guc6rke"},{"name":"khrusevo","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000ue19w41cr5o4s"},{"name":"about","_id":"ck8k0qgj1000we19we1ardn76"},{"name":"nepal","_id":"ck8k0qgj2000ye19wcvgh46fh"},{"name":"usa","_id":"ck8k0qgj20010e19w01mpais2"},{"name":"story","_id":"ck8k0qgj20012e19w9xx10bgz"},{"name":"mexico","_id":"ck8k0qgj30014e19wcu429l05"}]}}
