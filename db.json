And here's to practicing like a madman on ground and in the air to climb higher, smoother, and longer and travel the world with my head *just below* the clouds.\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/parastart.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\n## Ridge Soaring\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/ridge-soaring.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\nMore than a minute or two in the air? Off the training hill? Sold.\n\nI've been on the beaches and hiked the bluffs and ridges in Santa Barbara what must be hundreds of times, but soaring above them is the absolute best way to do it. One quick 10 minute flight, a quick stop off on the ground, and then I was off for an hour back and forth alond the ridge. Kept waiting for it to get old, going those same 100 yards over and over, but each lap had a little something new, a little bit of different challenge in it. Can I get higher on this next lap? Can I get past that horseshoe making that turbulent air over there and causing me to sink a ton?\n\nAdrenaline from the altitude and the speed (on the downwind leg at least) and the proximity to the cliffs. But its also adrenaline that has to be handled in a mellow fashion, gently working with the wing to move how it needs to and how I want it to.\n\nI was getting hooked on the training hill. Some actual flight time? Line and sinker. I spent the rest of the night dreaming of the sky while walking through the night.\n\n## First mountain flight\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/first-mountain.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\n\nOut of the car to Dilan yelling across the training hill - 'going to the mountains'. The universe provides the perfect conditions to cap off my P2 training with a long (by my newbie standards) sled ride from the top of the mountain range.\n\nWe get to VLR and I look out on the same view I've seen countless times before, all of Santa Barbara laid out below. This time I'm going to jump out over it. I'm calm and I'm ready to go. No jitters on launch, no fear, almost to a point where I'm concerned - should be some, right? But I know the glider will take care of me, and I know I'm ready to handle it up there. Or maybe I'm just OK with any outcome here.\n\nOne false start, quick reset, and then the wing is up, I'm turned around, three steps later I'm off the edge and shaking dried out shrubbery from my legs. Head up looking out, down, over at the entire world and settling into my seat, relaxing into the flight and tuning in to the wing.\n\nThe trip down has only a bit of lift - one thermal I managed to get around 3 or 4 times inside. Some turbulence here and there - good to get a feel for it and enough to let me know that I have a ways to go when it comes to knowing my glider and being completely in touch with its moods and inputs and outputs. Ton of altitude when I get to the LZ and it is a massive area to come down into. I aim at the dirt track leading to the car and come in swinging and hot, slide a bit on landing. Room to improve and I'm a bit unhappy with it because I know better. Already I'm into the zone where I want to get closer and closer to perfection with every flight - not enough to just slide through the air. I've got to justify the title of 'pilot'.\n\nDilan tells me world class pilots kite for an hour or two every day. That an hour of kiting is worth ten hours of flight time when it comes to being a better pilot. On it. I want to fly comps, and I want to fly acro. Basically I want to be in that harness, under that wing, and feel like they are as intuitive and comfortable and efficient as walking, as part of me as if they were my legs.\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/after-mountain.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\n## Lifted\n\nOut of the ground and into the sky blurring the lines between solidity and air. The branches twist and grow in arcs toward and around each other, leaves dancing in sunlit rainbows of green, mingling with blue sky and white cloud. Whispering through the trunks is the color of my dreams and the quiet shadows are pierced by eternally sun drenched hopes, leaving cares to lie on the soft dead needles on the ground. Feet shuffle through the detritus as eyes turn to the sky, hands run along rough bark as cool air flows through flared nostrils and half opened lips.\n\nit is dreams of flight that drive me forward - lifting high above the world and leaving the works of man behind. checking in and out of what we have created as a people... what good do we do at the end of it all? driving towards a divine judgement gives some kind of hope that there is anything beyond futility. but what else can there be? All turns to dust. How can we maintain that the things we do are for a greater purpose than to simply enjoy nature, enjoy life, exist in this world without destroying it? Time and again we race about in the hopes that we'll find something more... magnificent? More awe inspiring?\n\nLife in the mountains calls out. The quiet rhythm of wind and sun and rain flowing down rocky faces enraptures me and my mind flows back to that point time and again. Health and hearth and earth and heath - these words feel full to me, sound hearty to my ear and fill me with a solidity I do not otherwise feel. I am spinning my way down from the sky to find a groundedness I have not before known.\n\nIt runs through my imagination but does not manifest in my actions. That is where it is important - the only place it *can* be important really. Otherwise what use. Rubber meeting road and all that.\n","source":"_posts/Santa-Barbara.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Santa Barbara - Beginnings'\nsubtitle: 2018.07.01\ndate: 2018-07-01 14:31:45\ntags:\ncover_index: https://deeplineproject.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/ridge-soaring_cover.jpg\ncover_detail: https://deepline.gumlet.com/2018/07/01/Santa-Barbara/ridge-soaring.jpg\nlocation: [34.470148, -119.729265]\n---\nAn ancient collection of ramblings when I had just learned to fly.

Off the training hill? Sold.\n\nI've been on the beaches and hiked the bluffs and ridges in Santa Barbara what must be hundreds of times, but soaring above them is the absolute best way to do it. One quick 10 minute flight, a quick stop off on the ground, and then I was off for an hour back and forth alond the ridge. Kept waiting for it to get old, going those same 100 yards over and over, but each lap had a little something new, a little bit of different challenge in it. Can I get higher on this next lap? Can I get past that horseshoe making that turbulent air over there and causing me to sink a ton?\n\nAdrenaline from the altitude and the speed (on the downwind leg at least) and the proximity to the cliffs. But its also adrenaline that has to be handled in a mellow fashion, gently working with the wing to move how it needs to and how I want it to.\n\nI was getting hooked on the training hill. Some actual flight time? Line and sinker.

This time I'm going to jump out over it. I'm calm and I'm ready to go. No jitters on launch, no fear, almost to a point where I'm concerned - should be some, right? But I know the glider will take care of me, and I know I'm ready to handle it up there. Or maybe I'm just OK with any outcome here.\n\nOne false start, quick reset, and then the wing is up, I'm turned around, three steps later I'm off the edge and shaking dried out shrubbery from my legs.

Ton of altitude when I get to the LZ and it is a massive area to come down into. I aim at the dirt track leading to the car and come in swinging and hot, slide a bit on landing.

This lets me turn a business trip on a Thursday or Tuesday into a three day flying trip pretty easily but it also means I don't often see the same site twice. I don't have a 'home site' - in the ~20 months I've been flying I've flown in Mexico (Valle), Nepal (Pokhara), Ethiopia (another post or three's worth of sites), Morocco, Spain (Ager), France (Annecy, Chamonix, Greolieres), the UK (Lake District), and the US (Owens Valley, Santa Barbara, Shenendoah Valley).\n\nThis kind of discovery and travel is what I love about flying and I believe that the variety has made me a safer, and more well rounded pilot. It also has let me meet some of the best pilots around and be lucky enough to learn as much as my current skillset allows me to from them. But I also know that I am missing a ton of knowledge and I get what I can from the locals and the internets before I arrive. These posts are intended to help me record what I learn at these sites so I don't have to start from scratch every time.\n\n**So here's roughly what happens:**\n1. Work schedules me to go somewhere. Or, a bank holiday or something pops up.\n2. I look for something resembling a mountain nearby. Hills are also acceptable, coastal soaring isn't really my thing, and in one notable instance a 200 metre tall sand dune worked just fine. Cross Country Magazine's travel guide is referenced for time of year suggestions.\n3. Then the fun stuff starts. I go raid the biggest flights from XContest for the site. Then I get the biggest ones from whatever week of the year this is, last year. I'll take 5-10 of these and stick them in Ayvri* and Google Earth and proceed to fly my way around that landscape through the virtual dots of the best pilots I can find.\n4. A week before the trip I'm on meteoblue, windy, and xcskies (thinking about SkySight) every couple days trying to reconcile the tracks I've seen and the wind/weather patterns that are the reality I'll be flying in.\n5. Along with the weather I look at flights that go up on XContest and Leonardo locally each day to get an idea of what lines or launches match up.\n6. I get to the site, sometimes meet some locals (or lots of locals - looking at you Valle/Pokhara)\n\n<br>\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/meteoScreen.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\n<center>So many ways to look at the world!</center>\n<br>\n\nAnd rather than bounce around my brain until they fall out - these links will now go into a post! I reckon a pre- and post- post makes some sense because then I can do what this is really intended to do and showcase my regular mistakes to the world.\n\nFor example: ton of research on launches in Gréolières/Gourdon area. Today I get to the Gréolières car leaving spot to start the hike up. Take the wrong trail entirely, go more vertical than I ever needed to, end up finding a decent spot facing the wind half a kilometer down the ridge and call that my launch instead.\n\nI currently live directly in the intermediate pilot danger zone - I am confident under a wing, have done multiple SIVs, and have around 150 hours flown. Doing the research, learning what I can about weather from desk and not just in the air, ground handling all the damn time, watching other pilots, and never taking the dangers associated with this wonderful sport for granted are what I'm doing to get through that - my goal is to limit my mistakes to the kind from today that just make me get a bit more exercise and a bit creative with my layout.\n\nA very experienced pilot I met and flew with recently told me \"You are a very good pilot. Good enough to get yourself into situations, especially when it comes to landing, that you haven't seen before and that you won't know how to handle.\" Niki - I heard you loud and clear. Thank you for the reminder about taking the safer option at the most crucial point.\n\nAnd so the next post is on the Gourdon area, the research and links I used, weather guesses (I'm still not great at meteo), and actual flight learnings. Spoiler: I *loved* the XAlps 3.\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/carbon.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n<center>And it's carbon fibre handles. Which are clearly the secret to Chrigel's success.\n</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n*Yep, too new to call it Dooarama. Or to be able to contribute to discussions about how it sucks since the change. I love it.\n","source":"_posts/New-Endeavours.md","raw":"---\ntitle: New Endeavours\nsubtitle: 2020.03.18\ndate: 2020-03-14 08:13:22\ntags:\n- about\ncover_index: https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/ethiopia_cover.jpg\ncover_detail: https://deepline.gumlet.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/ethiopia.jpg\nlocation: [43.8005, 6.9556]\n---\nI went ahead and broke a few of the rules: I changed a couple things at the same time (glider: Swift 5 -> OXA3, vario: Oudie -> Xctracer/Flyskyhy), I decided to try out an EN-D **and** a 2 liner without ever touching an EN-C, and I added a GoPro to think about.

Cross Country Magazine's travel guide is referenced for time of year suggestions.\n3. Then the fun stuff starts. I go raid the biggest flights from XContest for the site. Then I get the biggest ones from whatever week of the year this is, last year. I'll take 5-10 of these and stick them in Ayvri* and Google Earth and proceed to fly my way around that landscape through the virtual dots of the best pilots I can find.\n4. A week before the trip I'm on meteoblue, windy, and xcskies (thinking about SkySight) every couple days trying to reconcile the tracks I've seen and the wind/weather patterns that are the reality I'll be flying in.\n5. Along with the weather I look at flights that go up on XContest and Leonardo locally each day to get an idea of what lines or launches match up.\n6. I get to the site, sometimes meet some locals (or lots of locals - looking at you Valle/Pokhara)\n\n<br>\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/meteoScreen.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n\n<center>So many ways to look at the world!</center>\n<br>\n\nAnd rather than bounce around my brain until they fall out - these links will now go into a post! I reckon a pre- and post- post makes some sense because then I can do what this is really intended to do and showcase my regular mistakes to the world.\n\nFor example: ton of research on launches in Gréolières/Gourdon area. Today I get to the Gréolières car leaving spot to start the hike up. Take the wrong trail entirely, go more vertical than I ever needed to, end up finding a decent spot facing the wind half a kilometer down the ridge and call that my launch instead.\n\nI currently live directly in the intermediate pilot danger zone - I am confident under a wing, have done multiple SIVs, and have around 150 hours flown. Doing the research, learning what I can about weather from desk and not just in the air, ground handling all the damn time, watching other pilots, and never taking the dangers associated with this wonderful sport for granted are what I'm doing to get through that - my goal is to limit my mistakes to the kind from today that just make me get a bit more exercise and a bit creative with my layout.\n\nA very experienced pilot I met and flew with recently told me \"You are a very good pilot. Good enough to get yourself into situations, especially when it comes to landing, that you haven't seen before and that you won't know how to handle.\" Niki - I heard you loud and clear. Thank you for the reminder about taking the safer option at the most crucial point.\n\nAnd so the next post is on the Gourdon area, the research and links I used, weather guesses (I'm still not great at meteo), and actual flight learnings. Spoiler: I *loved* the XAlps 3.\n\n![](https://deeplineproject.com/2020/03/14/New-Endeavours/carbon.jpg?format=auto&width=2000)\n<center>And it's carbon fibre handles.
